# Chatbot-with-DeepLearning-and-Python
*Scenario project*:  get a story and out that story we are going to ask a q and based on the story the chatbot will tell if our question is correct or not. All the conversation is in the form of Question and Answer format.

## Problem Statement:
In many conversational AI systems, understanding context and delivering accurate, relevant responses remain significant challengesâ€”especially when dealing with narrative content. This project aims to develop a Deep Learning-based chatbot using Python that can read and comprehend a given story, and then engage in a Question-and-Answer (Q&A) dialogue based on that story. The chatbot will determine whether the user's questions are relevant and factually correct in the context of the story. The goal is to explore the application of natural language understanding (NLU) in creating intelligent systems capable of contextual reasoning and accurate response generation within narrative-based conversations.
